# PyBer_Analysis
## Overview of the analysis
The purpose of this assignment was to use Pandas and Matplotlib to create a visulisation of ride-sharing data by city type. Showing the differances between rural, suburban, and urban areas.

## Results
The results show that there is a large difference in the total fare amount in each city type. Urban ares make the most, followed by suburban citys, and then rural cities at the bottom. Urban cities also had the most drives while rural areas had the least. Rural cities had the highest average fare while urban cities had the least. Rural areas also the highest fare per driver and urban had the lowest. Sales are lowest at the start of the year and peak in late Febuary for urban and suburban cities.

## Summary 
Business Recomendations:
1. Increace advertising in rural cities because they have lowest volume but best margins.
2. Have summer promotion to help sping down trend.
3. High demand urban cities could increase price to have higher average fare per driver.
